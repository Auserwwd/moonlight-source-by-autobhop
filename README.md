# moonlight-source-by-autobhop
Hi everyone, its autobhop, this moonlight is the source i was working on, i got this base from a friend that said it was osiris with inventory changer but it didnt have anything else, i worked on it, he paided me, i didnt run, i did everything has told, and he did know that it was osiris base, neither of us knew it was online bc the guy i got it from posted it, or one of his friends did, He texted me and came at me sideways about it, i explained everything to him, and he still said i had to pay him back and he threatend to take the money back, at that point i didnt care he could have the money,but he was still a dick, he was never a good owner, the menu you guys are using is the menu i worked on minus my code, its osiris my version is all my code, if youd like that version add me on discord at AutoBhop#8942 also add me for screenshots if i havent posted them by then, GG scarecrow ill be your downfall.
